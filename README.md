# Network-Design-for-Fayetteville-NC-Office

Setting up the new Fayetteville, NC, office network requires meeting the company’s needs while 
keeping things simple and reliable. The first step is to pick the right type of internet connection 
and way to transfer data. Fiber optic internet is the best choice because it’s fast, reliable, and 
handles video calls and large data transfers, like sending print jobs to the Albany office, without 
interruptions. A site-to-site VPN will securely connect the Fayetteville office to the company’s 
main network, allowing safe communication with Albany and Springfield offices. 
The office will need key network equipment, including managed switches to manage the network 
efficiently and grow as needed. A business-grade router with VPN support will handle traffic, 
and wireless access points with Wi-Fi 6 will provide fast and stable wireless connections for 
employees. Firewalls will protect the network from threats, and local servers will handle basic 
services like assigning IP addresses (DHCP) and managing internal names (DNS). The office 
will also need its own range of IP addresses. 
For the local network setup, there are a few options to consider. A star layout is easy to manage 
and expand, but if the main hub fails, the whole network goes down. A mesh layout is very 
reliable because devices are all connected, but it’s expensive and complicated. A hybrid setup 
combines the best of both—it’s reliable like a mesh but simpler and cheaper. 
The hybrid design is the best choice for Fayetteville. It provides flexibility and reliability without 
being too costly. A central switch will connect the most important devices, while smaller 
switches will handle connections in different areas. This setup makes it easy to manage and fix 
problems while keeping the network running smoothly, even if one part has issues. It also allows 
the network to grow as the company expands. 
The Fayetteville office will use fiber optic internet, a secure VPN connection, and a hybrid 
network layout to create a reliable and scalable system. This setup meets the company’s needs, 
supports its goals, and works seamlessly with the existing network.
